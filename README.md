# Sudoku Solver
As simple as the title suggests! Currently can solve up to **Hard** puzzles from [sudoku.com](https://sudoku.com/)

## Watch it go

## Known Bugs
- Currently I have implemented *rule propagation* and *singleton value* methods. This can only solve so far. The algorithm CAN and WILL get stuck some times!
- No loading different puzzles
